# **Hospital ticket automation app**
##### by JokÅ«bas Akramas
_This is web application for hospital queue management developed with Spring Boot and React.js._
### How to use  website
The working solution is available [here](http://hospital-app-ticket-bucket.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/) or by pasting link in browser `http://hospital-app-ticket-bucket.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/`. The first time you run website you should see gray box with welcoming message and cookie usage alert. When you load page second time it will be gone.
1. Main window
Unless you have an active session as a customer or a specialist this is default screen where the app starts.

Here you have one of two options from whom to choose:
- __Generate ticket__:  Select a specialist from specialist list in dropdown list and click `Generate ticket`. This is when your session will be created and your browser will receive JSON web token as cookie for further communication with the backend.
- __Login as specialist__:  Press `Login as specialist` from bottom left corner. You will be presented with a modal with login form. Fill the form with correct credentials and press `Login`. Upon successfull login your browser will receive JSON web token as cookie for further communication with the backend.

    Here are all the available specialists credentials list.
    Title | Password
    ------------ | -------------
    Allergist | allergist12345
    Anesthesiologist | anesthesiologist12345
    Cardiologist | cardiologist12345
    Colon Surgeon | colonsurgeon12345
    Dermatologist | dermatologist12345
    Dentist | dentist12345
    Endocrinologist | endocrinologist12345
    Family Physician | familyphysician12345
    Gastroenterologist | gastroenterologist12345

2. Customer queue window
    When you generate a ticket you will be redirected to this window. In this window you will see your visit's details and customer queue before you.
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47061836/113437936-3ecd2d00-93f0-11eb-913e-8e016c031f73.png)
    __Your visit time is generated automatically by backend and will depend on the last due (for this specialist) visit time and specialist's default visit time (this is set by administrator in database for every specialist).__
    In this view you have the ability to cancel the visit and see queue in real time. For example, `DENT-070` cancelled their visit, so you and other customers that are after aforementioned visit will receive new time and an alert of the action. 
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47061836/113437978-54425700-93f0-11eb-9e77-9ee1243ebd33.png)
    Time for each affected customer is reassigned by setting previous customer's time (for example, time when we first joined this window was *21:05*, now it is *20:55*)  
    Alerts may be due to:
    - Someone in front of you (or you) cancelling visit. You will not receive alerts about this activity if customer is behind you.
    - Specialist starting/ending/cancelling visit for you or someone in front of you.
    
    Alerts and queue updates are executed without refreshing the screen by using STOMP messaging protocol for the best UX.

    Sub-windows
    - Visit start

    After visit was ended or cancelled you can go back to main page. 
    
3. Specialist window
    When you login as specialist you will be redirected to this window. In this window you will be able to see and manage customers, registered for your consultation.

    As a specialist you can:
    - Cancel your any visit. You can't cancel other specialists' visits.
    - Start the first visit if it's status is due. Once you start, you cannot cancel the visit.

    - End started visit.
